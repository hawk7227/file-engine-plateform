      "color_choice": "The {color} palette works for {industry} because {reason}. The primary at {hex} gives enough vibrancy for CTAs without being aggressive. I tinted the dark background toward {hue} ({bg_hex}) so the accent color feels integrated rather than floating on neutral black.",
      "spacing_choice": "The spacing follows a base-4 scale (8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 48, 64, 80px). Section padding is {section_padding}px — enough breathing room between sections without feeling wasteful. Card padding at 32px gives content room to breathe. The gap between grid items at {gap}px maintains visual connection while separating distinct cards.",
      "layout_choice": "I used a {layout} layout because {reason}. For {content_type}, users scan in a {pattern} pattern, so placing {element} at {position} captures attention first. The {columns} column grid at this breakpoint ensures each card has enough width to display its content comfortably."
